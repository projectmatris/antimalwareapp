    <string name="real_time_scan_desc">Real Time Scan is a feature that enables the anti-malware application to detect new app installations on the device and scan them. If enabled, the anti-malware app can automatically scan newly installed applications. You can enable/disable this feature in settings. This feature is enabled by default.</string>
    <string name="how_it_works_desc">LibreAV uses permissions and intent-filters to detect malicious apps. While scanning, it loads the machine learning model and extracts permissions and intents from the installed applications on your device. These extracted features are then fed to the machine learning model in the form of a vector. The machine learning model returns a prediction score between 0 and 1 that denote the degree of maliciousness of the scanned application. We use this score to classify the scanned app into one of the following categories:</string>
